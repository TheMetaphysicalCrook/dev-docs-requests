# Doc Requests

Kapeli supports a lot of documentation sets, but not all. That's ok. There's only so much one person can do. All the unofficial ones are scattered around Github and may not be kept up to date. That's ok, too!

This is an unofficial orchestration of curating all the unofficial docsets in an effort to help keep things up to date.

Open an issue if:

- you're currently a maintainer of a docset feel free to open up an issue and I'll make you an owner so you can transfer it over. 
- there's a docset you're struggling to create on your own
- you don't have time to create a docset but really really really wish there was one!
- you want to help but aren't sure how to generate docsets
- you have an idea for generating docsets on the fly when these public repos are updated!
