# Dash Docs Community

Welcome!

Kapi supports a lot of documentation sets, but not all of them. That's ok! There's only so much one person can do. Unofficial docsets are typically maintained by one individual and may not be up to date. That's ok too!

This is an unofficial orchestration of curating all unofficial docsets in an effort to stay up to date.

## Open an issue if:

- you currently maintain a docset and would rather become an owner here and have the community help maintain it instead
- there's a docset you're struggling to create on your own
- you want to help but you aren't sure how yet
- you have an idea for generating docsets on the fly

## We <3 Dash

This isn't an attack on Dash by any means. We support and love Dash! We are power-users that love when our documentation is fresh and hate when we have to fall back to the browser.
